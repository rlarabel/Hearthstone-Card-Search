# A2: Hearthstone Card Search

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

1.  **Write** a Makefile to compile a simple C program.
2.  **Use** file stream functions to open and read files.
3.  **Use** file stream functions to read and write binary files.
4.  **Create** a program that will parse file content for display.
5.  **Create** a program that can search a database using an index data structure.
6.  **Use** memory allocator functions.

Specifications
--------------

For this assignment, you will continue building the program from A1 that parses a .csv file full of Hearthstone card data. It will also de-duplicate, sort and then **dump the cards to a pair of binary files**. These files will then be used by a second program to search for cards the user enters at the prompt.

### Stream I/O

You may use file streams for this assignment. Gone are the dark ages of having to deal with a too-tiny buffer!

### Array of Pointers to Structs

The data structure we want to use for this assignment is **a dynamic array of `CARD_T*`** or pointers to `CARD_T` structs. That means the data type of `cards` needs to be `CARD_T**`. You will also need a companion data structure **a dynamic array of `INDEX_T*`** or pointers to `INDEX_T` structs. This will be used to store a card's name and offset inside the `index.bin` file.

### Obtaining a Line from stdin

I strongly recommend continuing to use the `getline()` function. You can pass this function the special wizard word `stdin` in order for it to read from the standard input stream (this is where characters you type on the keyboard end up). You should read user input until the user enters a single lowercase `q` and presses enter. Don't forget to `free()` the memory allocated by the function before you exit the program or you will have a Valgrind error!

### Binary File Format

It's difficult to communicate visually on eLearning (or Mimir) the format of the binary files. Using the tool **xxd** we can obtain a hexdump of the two files that the solution program generates:

    $ xxd cards.bin | head

Notice that this is just the top of each file (the first 160 bytes). The `index.bin` file will first contain the `total_cards` value in **8 bytes**. Then it will contain that many records of:

1.  **4 bytes** for the _length of the card name_
2.  **?? bytes** for the _card name_ (the previous 4 bytes is how many bytes you need to read to obtain the entire card name)
3.  **8 bytes** for the _offset into the `cards.bin` file where the rest of the data lies_

The `cards.bin` file will contain `total_cards` number of records of:

1.  **4 bytes** for the _card id_
2.  **4 bytes** for the _card cost_
3.  **4 bytes** for the _card type_
4.  **4 bytes** for the _card class_
5.  **4 bytes** for the _card rarity_
6.  **4 bytes** for the _length of the card text_
7.  **?? bytes** for the _card text_ (the previous 4 bytes is how many you need bytes you need to read to obtain the entire card text)
8.  **4 bytes** for the _card's attack_
9.  **4 bytes** for the _card's health_

Now it might be clearer how much easier it is to use enums for data storage. For any of the `char*` fields, we must store both **the length** and **the data itself**. However, the rest of the fields are simply numbers. The only number that needs more than **4 bytes** is the offset for the card in the `index.bin` file.

### Restrictions

*   You must compile your program using the flags `std=gnu11`, `-Werror` and `-Wall`.
*   You must implement the stubbed functions: `dupe_check()`, `fix_text()`, `free_card()`, `parse_card()`, `print_card()`
*   You must adhere to the expected binary format or the testers will fail!

### Echoing Search String When Input Is Redirected

You must call `isatty(0)` to determine whether input is coming from a terminal or redirected file input. If you have an `input.txt` file with contents:

    BEEEES!!!
    Flamestrike
    Notareal Card
    Slep Bunwalla
    Goliath, Sneed's Masterpiece
    Leeroy Jenkins
    q

(which is the search strings for the example listed below) and you execute your program like:

    $ ./search < input.txt

and the output **is not identical to the example below, then you have not echoed the search string when input is redirected file input instead of from the standard input stream**. Read the manpage for `isatty()` and call it in your program such that the search string is echoed (printed) to the screen before the search is performed and the result is printed.

If done correctly, it will not matter if your program is executed as above or as below in the example, both should yield identical output.

### Submission

Submit only your completed `parser.c` file, `search.c` file, `card.h` and associated `Makefile`. When `make` is executed in the directory, a binary named `parser` **and also a binary named `search`** should be created. If not, the autograder will fail. You can make a submission as many times as you'd like in order to see the autograder feedback. The maximum points you can receive from the autograder is 12 and the remaining 12 points are from code review.

### Functions

Here is a list of functions that are used by the solution programs. This might help in completing the assignment:

*   `atoi()`
*   `bsearch()`
*   `build_index()`
*   `dupe_check()`
*   `fclose()`
*   `find_compar()`
*   `fix_text()`
*   `fopen()`
*   `fprintf()`
*   `fread()`
*   `free()`
*   `free_card()`
*   `free_index()`
*   `fseeko()`
*   `ftello()`
*   `fwrite()`
*   `getline()`
*   `isatty()`
*   `lfind()`
*   `malloc()`
*   `memcpy()`
*   `memmove()`
*   `parse_card()`
*   `print_card()`

*   `strcmp()`
*   `strdup()`
*   `strlen()`

*   `strstr()`
*   `write_card()`
*   `write_index()`

Example
-------

Here's sample out from a working program. ***Your program must not print out anything other than what's shown or the autograder will fail***. The `$` character represents the terminal prompt, you do not type this character when executing commands.
